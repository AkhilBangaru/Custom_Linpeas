**Custom linPEAS** is an **interactive Linux local enumeration framework** inspired by *linPEAS*, designed with a **clean TUI menu**, **selectable checks**, and **readable output** for learning, labs, and exam environments.

It focuses on **clarity, structure, and usability**, rather than dumping overwhelming output.

> Built for **educational purposes**, **CTF labs**

##  Installation

No dependencies required beyond standard Linux utilities.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/custom-linpeas.git
cd custom-linpeas
chmod +x custom_lineaps.sh
```

---

##  Usage

Run the script:

```
./custom_lineaps.sh
```

You will see an **interactive menu** where you can:

* Press `1–24` → Toggle individual checks
* Press `A` → Select all checks
* Press `C` → Clear all selections
* Press `S` → Start scan
* Press `Q` → Quit

---

##  Output Structure

All results are saved in a timestamped directory:

```
custom_lineaps_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

Each command output follows this format:

```
custom_lineaps_<sectionID>_<cmdNumber>_<command>.txt
```

### Example:

```
custom_lineaps_04_01_network_interfaces.txt
custom_lineaps_09_01_suid_binaries.txt
```

This makes it easy to:

* Review findings later
* Attach results to reports
* Navigate during exams or labs

---

##  Design Philosophy

* **Readable over noisy**
* **Manual thinking over blind automation**
* **Enumeration, not exploitation**
* **Educational and exam-friendly**

This tool is intentionally **non-exploitative** and focuses on helping you **identify attack surfaces**, not abuse them automatically.

---

##  Extending the Tool

Adding new checks is straightforward:

1. Create a new function for the check
2. Add it to the menu list
3. Hook it into the scan execution block

The menu system is **row-based and fixed-width**, so UI stays clean.

---

##  Disclaimer

This tool is intended **only for authorized environments**, such as:

* Your own systems
* Labs
* CTFs
* Educational practice

Do **not** use this tool on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
